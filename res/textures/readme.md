# VulkanCraft Textures
These textures have been taken from the Faithful32-1.10.2 repo at the F32Organizaiton github:

https://github.com/F32Organization/Faithful32-1.10.2/

Licensing information for the texture pack (1.7.10 version) leads me to believe it is okay to use and redistribute these textures. Taken from the readme.md file:

```
**License:**

You may use/modify this pack in any way you see fit. You may not profit from its distribution or the distribution of derivatives.
```
